# FPGA Implementation of PID Controller using Distributed Arithmetic Algorithm:                                        
•	Designed PID controller by using Distributive Arithmetic Algorithm for Xilinx Spartan-3E FPGA Board in Verilog.  
•	Implemented Lookup Table instead of Multipliers and, reduced the cell utilization by 80% and path delay by 50%.  
•	Interfaced Xilinx and Matlab using System Generator in Simulink and tested the setup for DC Motor.
